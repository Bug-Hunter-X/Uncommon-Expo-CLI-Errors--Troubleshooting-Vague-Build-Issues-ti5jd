# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors: Troubleshooting Vague Build Issues

This repository demonstrates a scenario where vague error messages from the Expo CLI can be encountered.  The issue revolves around inconsistencies between libraries and the Expo SDK version, resulting in unhelpful error messages during the build process.

## Problem

Expo CLI errors can sometimes lack specific details, making debugging challenging.  This example shows how an incompatibility between a library (e.g., `react-native-maps`) and the Expo SDK version can lead to an ambiguous error message.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking the compatibility between your Expo SDK version and all third-party libraries used in your project.  This often includes updating libraries to versions compatible with your Expo SDK or downgrading your SDK to match compatible library versions (when possible).  Thorough dependency management and version checking are key.

## Reproducing the Issue

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Run `npm install`.
3.  Try to start the Expo project using `expo start`. (You'll likely encounter a cryptic error)

## Fixing the Issue

1.  Check the documentation for all your libraries (e.g., `react-native-maps`) to find their compatibility ranges with Expo SDK versions.
2.  Update the library (using `expo install react-native-maps@latest`) or adjust the Expo SDK version in your `app.json` file to match the compatible versions.
3.  Run `expo start` again.
