The core of fixing this is to ensure that your `package.json` lists compatible versions of all packages. For example, you might need to add version specifiers to your dependencies:

```javascript
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-maps": "^1.3.2",
    "expo": "~47.0.0" //Or your compatible Expo SDK version
  }
}
```

Also carefully review the Expo documentation and the specific documentation for any libraries you are using. Pay attention to compatibility matrices and known issues. If you are still struggling, try creating a minimal reproducible example to isolate the issue and share it on the Expo forums or GitHub for assistance.
