This error typically occurs when you're using a library or feature within Expo CLI that's either not fully compatible with your project's setup or has undergone recent changes.  Let's say you're using a specific version of a library (like react-native-maps) that's incompatible with your Expo SDK version. The error message might not be super descriptive, leading to confusion.
